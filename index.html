                                                                Peter was born, when his biological father, Mickey McFinnagin took his then-girlfriend, (Peter's mother), Thelma to an extreme bull fighting show. At the show, Mickey took Thelma into the port-a-potty with her and knocked her up, impregnatig her with Peter, and then left the day after, never calling her again. Months later, Thelma decided to get an abortion, so she went to Mexico, to have the illegal prodecure done at Embryo Bell. However, at this point in the pregnancy, the baby was too developed and it was too late for an abortion, despite her only being pregnant for six months and Peter was prematurely born there on the spot. When Thelma saw her newborn child, she thought he was beautiful and wanted to raise him and care for him, so he could live a full life. So, she went back to America. However, she was too embarassed about what happened to tell anyone about it, so she never filled out the proper files to legally make Peter into an American citizen, so he technically remained an illegal immigrant for most of his life.
                                                                Not wanting Peter to grow up without a father, Thelma married Francis Griffin and passed him off as Peter's biological father, throughout his entire childhood, not telling Peter the actual truth.

                                                                Tthe ghost of Patrick Swayze took Peter back to a Christmas, when Peter was 5 years old.
                                                                When Peter was 6 years old, Thelma gave birth to his sister, Karen Griffin, who would always abuse and bully him.

                                                                During his high school years, Peter and his friend, Cleveland, got a part-time job, working as a towel boy for the rich pricks in Newport, where he was mistreated by the workers and sorrowfully underpaid. There, he met Lois for the first time. He fell in love with her and became her friend, much to the disapproval of Carter Pewterschmidt, who only wanted Lois to go out with rich white people from Newport. During high school, Glenn Quagmire was the love rival of Peter, who was also courting Lois and if it wasn't for Peter, Lois would have married Quagmire.

One thing is for certain, however. Peter married Lois in the '90s, much to the disapproval of the latter's parents, as well as Peter's father and as for Peter and Lois, it was the happiest day of both of their lives.

Out of pity he also adopted an intellectual talking dog named Brian who formerly lived on the street as a stray.

His vestigial twin was named Chip Griffin and he basically looked like a miniature version of himself with a chubbier head and somehow, glasses despite being trapped under his skin for all those years. Chip was surgically removed and sent away.

                                                Peter Griffin has undeniably proven to be a complete idiot. He is making stupid, unintelligent comments followed by him performing a ridiculous action. He never learns from his mistakes and will always go right back to doing them again. All in all, he's your everyday comedic idiot and definitely falls under the "stupid" category.

                                                Looking deeper into Peter's stupidity, we can see that most of his brainless behavior seems to be done out of immaturity. At times he demonstrates the intelligence level of a teenage boy in his "jackass" phase, pulling off dumb and dangerous stunts that only get him hurt and at other times, he acts like a four year old boy, taking on the personality of a little kid perfectly.

                                                Peter never passed the third grade. Despite having not passed the third grade, he was seen passing the fourth grade. Also, there's been a lot of flashbacks to him in middle school and high school and college, so I guess it's reasonable to say that even though he never technically passed those grades, the school board still let him move on to other grades and he can just go back to those classes and waste his time on school whenever he wants.

                                                Also despite being married to Lois for 20 years, he was unable to realize she was in danger despite her acting very odd. As well as was more interested in listening to his songs than to pay any real attention. He also firmly believed that Derek Wilcox was a God due to the fact the picture on his phone made him look as if he was holding up the Hollywood sign, despite Derek clearing explaining to him it was merely a camera trick.

Although Peter will occasionally drive Lois nuts with his crazy antics and nonsensical behavior, she still loves him and he still loves her. When the show went through seasonal rot, this all changed, where the new formula of the shoe was Peter drives Lois crazy by being an obnoxious idiotic husband who doesn't respect and cherish her and treats her like shit and she still stays with him for no reason.

They enjoy hanging out at their local bar, The Drunken Clam, drinking and chewing the fat. The four men do many things together. Once the four friends entered and won a costume contest at an 80s TV convention, dressing up as the A-Team. On another occasion, their fishing boat was wrecked, and they were stranded together on a desert island.

                                                <strong><em>Giant Chicken</em></strong> - the feud starts over a trivial incident where the chicken gives Peter an expired coupon at the grocery store. The chicken is identified as "Ernie", and he has a wife named Nicole, also a giant chicken. Peter is invited to dinner with them after they realize that their fighting is pointless, but then they argue over who will pay the bill, and the fighting starts all over again. Ernie makes a brief, non-fighting appearance, in which Peter unwittingly assaults the giant chicken at a 90s dance, retroactively providing Ernie with a grudge against Peter. Ernie was also mentioned when Peter was hospitalized due to kidney failure, Brian offered to give Peter his kidney. In response to the family's shock, Dr. Hartman stated that this transplant was not the only crazy thing that took place in medical research, and said that he once attempted to clone a chicken. This resulted in the original chicken to grow human-sized, violent, and incredibly hostile.

Periodically, Peter is shown recovering quickly from serious injuries, such as losing all the fingers on his right hand while handling M-70 firecrackers. In spite of the injury, he has no visible scarring on his hand. He displays enormous strength, such as when single handedly challenging a professional football team in "Patriot Games". Peter played high school football and his sister mentions his wearing a bra while playing.

                                                After eating thirty hamburgers in one sitting, Peter suffered a stroke that paralyzed the left side of his body. For the next three months he walked with a limp, his arm and leg hung lifelessly from his body, and his eye and part of his mouth had slid down his face, giving him a speech impediment. This damage was reversed completely after a five minute session at a stem cell research facility.
